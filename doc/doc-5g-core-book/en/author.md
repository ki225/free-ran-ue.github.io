    <p>Hi, I'm Feng Tu (Alonza), currently working as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.saviah.com/en">Saviah Technologies</a>, and I'm also a core maintainer of <a href="https://free5gc.org">free5GC</a>.</p>
    <p>During my journey of learning and researching 5G, I found that many beginners face the same challenge: not knowing where to start. Therefore, I decided to compile my learning process and practical experience into this book, hoping to help more people quickly enter the world of 5G.</p>

    <p>Hi, I'm Kiki! I’m currently a bachelor’s student who got into networking through Cloud, and along the way, I found myself stepping into the world of 5G.</p>
    <p>When I first started learning 5G, I honestly felt quite lost and didn’t know where to begin. I hope this English version helps others get a head start with <a href="https://free5gc.org">free5GC</a>, especially for beginners who are looking for a structured place to start, just like I was.</p>
