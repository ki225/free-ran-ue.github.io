    <p>Hi, I'm Feng Tu (Alonza), currently working as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.saviah.com/en">Saviah Technologies</a>, and I'm also a core maintainer of <a href="https://free5gc.org">free5GC</a>.</p>
    <p>During my journey of learning and researching 5G, I found that many beginners face the same challenge: not knowing where to start. Therefore, I decided to compile my learning process and practical experience into this book, hoping to help more people quickly enter the world of 5G.</p>

    <p>Hi, I'm Kiki! I’m currently a bachelor’s student who got into networking through cloud technologies. After being introduced to 5G in my senior year, I decided to dive deeper into the field in graduate school.</p>
    <p>When I first started learning 5G, I honestly felt quite lost and didn’t know where to begin. Therefore, I hope this book provides a clearer direction for anyone looking to learn 5G with <a href="https://free5gc.org">free5GC</a>, making the journey a little easier for beginners—just like I once needed.</p>
